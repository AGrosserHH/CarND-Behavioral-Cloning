# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning
Udacity Self Driving Car - 3rd Project - Behavioral Cloning

#General overview
In the third project of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree program we should create a CNN in order to steer a car around a pre-defined road. 

#Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode
My project includes the following files:
- model.py containing the script to create and train the model
- drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
- model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
- writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#Submssion includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing
python drive.py model.h5

#Submssion code is usable and readable
The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works

#Model and data description
For an overview of the data generating process and training please see the file writeup_report-pdf.
